Hybrid Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm with varying time quantum (HRR)combines the features of SJF and RR scheduling algorithms with varying time quantum. Initially the processes in the ready queue are arranged in the ascending order of their remaining burst time. CPU is allocated to the processes using RR scheduling with time quantum value equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue. After each cycle processes in the ready queue are arranged in the ascending order of their remaining burst time and CPU is allocated to the processes using RR scheduling with time quantum value equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue. Following is the proposed HRR CPU scheduling algorithm.
1.Make a ready queue RQUEUE of the Processes submitted for execution.
2. DO steps 3 to 9 WHILE queue RQUEUE becomes empty.
3. Arrange the processes in the ready queue REQUEST in the ascending order of their remaining burst time.
4. Set the time quantum value equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue RQUEUE.
5. Pick the first process from the ready queue RQUEUE and allocate CPU to this process for a time interval of up to 1 time quantum.
6. Remove the currently running process from the ready queue
RQUEUE, since it has finished execution and the remaining burst time is zero.
7. REPEAT steps 8 and 9 UNTIL all processes in the ready queue gets the CPU time interval up to 1 time quantum.
8. Pick the next process from the ready queue RQUEUE, and allocate CPU for a time interval of up to 1 time quantum.
9. IF the currently running process has finished execution and the remaining CPU burst time of the currently running process is zero, remove it from the ready queue ELSE remove the currently running process from the ready queue RQUEUE and put it at the tail of the ready queue.
Illustration
A ready queue with four processes P1, P2, P3 and P4 has been considered for illustration purpose.
The processes are arriving at time 0 with burst time 12, 8, 21 and 15 respectively. The processes P1, P2, P3 and P4 are arranged in the ascending order of their burst time in the ready queue which gives the sequence P2, P1, P4 and P3. The time quantum value is set equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue i.e. 8. CPU is allocated to the processes P2, P1, P4 and P3 from the ready queue for a time quantum of 8 milliseconds (ms). After first cycle, the remaining burst International Journal of Computer Science, Engineering and
Applications (IJCSEA) Vol.4, No.4, August 2014 time for P2, P1, P4 and P3 are 0, 4, 7 and 13 respectively. The process P2 has finished execution, so it is removed from the ready queue. The processes P1, P3 and P4 are arranged in the ascending order of their remaining burst time in the ready queue which gives the sequence P1, P4 and P3.
The time quantum value is set equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue i.e. 4.CPU is allocated to the processes P1, P4 and P3 from the ready queue for a time quantum of 4 ms. After second cycle, the remaining burst time for P1, P4 and P3 are 0, 3 and 9 respectively. The process P1 has finished execution, so it is removed from the ready queue. The processes P3 and P4 are arranged in the ascending order of their remaining burst time in the ready queue which gives the sequence P4 and P3. The time quantum value is set equal to the burst time of first process in the ready queue i.e. 3. CPU is allocated to the processes P4 and P3 from the ready queue for a time quantum of 3 ms. After third cycle, the remaining burst time for P4 and P3 are 0 and 6 respectively. The process P4 has finished execution, so it is removed from the ready queue. Now only process P3 is in the ready queue, so CPU is
allocated to P3 for a time quantum of 6 ms which is the burst time of first process in the ready queue. The waiting time is 24 ms for P1, 0 ms for P2, 35 ms for P3 and 32 ms for P4. The average waiting time is 22.75 ms. With the same set of process with same arrival and CPU burst times, the average waiting time is 25.75 ms for time quantum 8, 27.75 ms for time quantum 4, 29.25 ms for time quantum 3 and 28.75 ms for time quantum 6 in RR. The average turnaround time is 41.75 in IRRVQ while average turnaround time is 39.75 for time quantum 8, 41.75 for time quantum 4, 43.25 for time quantum 3 and 42.75 for time quantum 6 in RR.
